	abstract = {Background Quantitative sensory testing of thermal detection abilities is used as a clinical tool to assess the function of pain pathways. The most common procedure to assess thermal sensitivity, the ‘method of limits’, provides a quick but rough estimate of detection thresholds. Here, we investigate the potential of evaluating not only the threshold but also the slope of the psychometric functions for cold and warm detection. Method A convenience sample of 15 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and 15 age-matched healthy controls (HC) was tested. Thirty brief (100 ms) stimuli of each modality were applied to the volar wrist and foot dorsum. Cold and warm stimuli were delivered with a Peltier thermode and a temperature-controlled CO2 laser, respectively. Stimulus intensities were dynamically selected using an adaptive Bayesian algorithm (psi method) maximizing information gain for threshold and slope estimation. ROC analyses were used to assess the ability of slopes, thresholds and the combination of both to discriminate between groups. Results Assessment of the slope and threshold of the psychometric function for thermal detection took about 10 min. The ability to detect warmth was not reduced in DM patients as compared to HC. Cold detection performance assessed using slope or threshold parameters separated DM from HC with good discriminative power. Discrimination was further increased when both parameters were used together (93\% sensitivity and 87\% specificity), indicating that they provide complementary information on patient status. Conclusion The psi method may be an interesting alternative to the classical method of limits for thermal QST. Significance Current QST protocols provide an incomplete and potentially biased estimate of sensory detection performance. We propose a method that estimates the slope and the threshold of the psychometric function, defining heat and cold sensory detection performance, in only a few minutes. Furthermore, we provide preliminary evidence that combining slope and threshold parameters of cold detection performance leads to a better discriminative ability than relying solely on the threshold.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have documented an inverse relationship between blood pressure and sensitivity to experimental nociceptive stimulation. The present study aimed to investigate possible associations between blood pressure and the occurrence and intensity of paradoxical pain induced by the thermal grill paradigm. Thirty-one healthy subjects were stimulated three times for 1 min with the nonnoxious temperatures of 15°C and 41°C set at the interlaced cold and warm bars of a water bath-driven thermal grill. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded concomitantly. On account of previous observations of an association between the sensitivity of the cardiac baroreflex and pain perception, this parameter was additionally obtained. Numerical rating scales were used to quantify subjective pain intensity and pain unpleasantness; subjects were classified as responders and nonresponders to thermal grill stimulation based on pain intensity ratings. Responders exhibited lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure than nonresponders, and inverse linear associations arose between blood pressure and pain intensity and unpleasantness. Baroreflex sensitivity was unrelated to pain ratings. The findings confirmed the hypothesis of a blood pressure dependence of paradoxical pain and support the notion that the cardiovascular and pain regulatory systems interact not only in the processing of pain elicited by noxious input, but also in nonnoxiously generated illusive pain. While this finding is not consistent with the assumption of an involvement of the baroreflex system in mediating the observed interaction, psychological traits and neurochemical factors are alternatively considered.},

	abstract = {It is well documented that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by reduced pain sensitivity, which might be related to nonsuicidal self-injury and dissociative experiences in patients with BPD. However, it remains an open question whether this insensitivity relies at least partly on altered sensory integration or on an altered evaluation of pain or a combination of both. In this study, we used the thermal grill illusion (TGI), describing a painful sensation induced by the application of alternating cold and warm nonnoxious stimuli, in patients with either current or remitted BPD as well as matched healthy controls. Two additional conditions, applying warm or cold temperatures only, served as control. We further assessed thermal perception, discrimination, and pain thresholds. We found significantly reduced heat and cold pain thresholds for the current BPD group, as well as reduced cold pain thresholds for the remitted BPD group, as compared with the HC group. Current BPD patients perceived a less-intense TGI in terms of induced pain and unpleasantness, while their general ability to perceive this kind of illusion seemed to be unaffected. Thermal grill illusion magnitude was negatively correlated with dissociation and traumatization only in the current BPD patients. These results indicate that higher-order pain perception is altered in current BPD, which seems to normalize after remission. We discuss these findings against the background of neurophysiological evidence for the TGI in general and reduced pain sensitivity in BPD and suggest a relationship to alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate neurotransmission.},

A total of 28 healthy control individuals underwent three testing sessions on separate days. Briefly, 15 contact heat stimuli were delivered to the right hand dorsum, while the left palmar side of the hand was being conditioned with either neutral (32 °C), cool (20 °C), warm (40 °C), or TGI (20/40 °C). Rating of perception (numeric rating scale: 0–10) and evoked potentials (i.e., N1 and N2P2 potentials) to noxious contact heat stimuli were assessed. While cool and warm conditioning decreased cortical responses to noxious heat, TGI conditioning increased evoked potential amplitude (N1 and N2P2). In line with other modalities of unpleasant conditioning (e.g., sound, visual, and olfactory stimulation), cortical and possibly sub-cortical modulation may underlie the facilitation of contact heat evoked potentials.},

Here, we investigated the effect of sensitization of heat-sensitive neurons on cold and warm integration. We examined thermal thresholds, PHS, and warm, cold, and pain sensations to alternating cold (10°C) and warm (40°C) bars (the thermal grill [TG]) in the primary area (application site) after topical application with capsaicin and vehicle control (ethanol) on the volar forearms in randomized order in 80 healthy participants. As expected, capsaicin induced heat allodynia and hyperalgesia and decreased cold and cold pain sensation. In addition, we found that after capsaicin application, the TG caused less pain and burning than the 40°C bars alone in contrast to the control side where the TG caused more pain and burning, consistent with the thermal grill illusion. In both situations, the pain intensity during the TG correlated inversely with both cold and warm pain thresholds but not with detection thresholds. Paradoxical heat sensation was only seen in 3 participants after control application but in 19 participants after capsaicin. Those with PHS after capsaicin application had higher detection thresholds to both cold and warm than those without PHS, but there was no difference in thermal pain threshold. These results suggest that a complex cross talk among several cold and warm sensitive pathways shapes thermal perception.},

In the present study, we analyzed the conditions of production of this unique experimental illusion of pain in 52 healthy volunteers (27 men, 25 women). The stimuli were produced by a thermode composed of six bars whose temperature was controlled by Peltier elements. The temperature of alternate (even- and odd-numbered) bars could be controlled independently to produce various patterns of the 'thermal grill'. After measuring the cold and heat pain thresholds, a series of combinations of warm and cold stimuli, whose distance to the thermal pain threshold was at least 4 degrees C, were applied on the palmar surface of the right hand during 30s. After each stimulus, the subjects had to describe and rate their sensations on visual analog scales. Paradoxical painful sensations, mostly described as burning, were reported by all the subjects but three. However, the phenomenon was less frequent in approximately one third of ('low responder') volunteers. The frequency and intensity of such painful sensations were directly related to the magnitude (i.e. 5-25 degrees C) of the difference of the temperature between the warm and cold bars of the grill. The combination of increasingly colder temperature to a given warm temperature induces similar effects as combining increasingly warmer temperature to a given cold temperature. These results suggest that pain can be the result of a simple addition of non-noxious warm and cold signals.},

	abstract = {The perceived distance between touches on a single skin surface is larger on regions of high tactile sensitivity than those with lower acuity, an effect known as Weber's illusion. This illusion suggests that tactile size perception involves a representation of the perceived size of body parts preserving characteristics of the somatosensory homunculus. Here, we investigated how body shape is coded within this representation by comparing tactile distances presented in different orientations on the hand. Participants judged which of two tactile distances on the dorsum of their left hand felt larger. One distance was aligned with the proximodistal axis (along the hand), the other with the mediolateral axis (across the hand). Across distances were consistently perceived as larger than along ones. A second experiment showed that this effect is specific to the hairy skin of the hand dorsum and does not occur on glabrous skin of the palm. A third experiment demonstrated that this bias reflects orientation on the hand surface, rather than an eye- or torso-centered reference frame. These results mirror known orientational anisotropies of both tactile acuity and of tactile receptive fields (RFs) of cortical neurons. We suggest that the dorsum of the hand is implicitly represented as wider than it actually is and that the shape of tactile RFs may partly explain distortions of mental body representations.},

The difference between the cold-warm temperatures eliciting paradoxical warmth was significantly smaller than that producing paradoxical pain. The intensities of the warmth and unpleasantness evoked by the stimuli were directly related to the magnitude of the warm-cold differential. Our results suggest that there is a continuum between the painful and nonpainful paradoxical sensations evoked by the thermal grill that may share pathophysiological mechanisms.

METHODS: To examine the classes of peripheral axons that might contribute to this illusion, the effects of topical l-menthol, an activator of TRPM8, and cinnamaldehyde, a TRPA1 agonist, on the magnitude of thermal sensations were examined during grill stimulation in healthy volunteers.
RESULTS: Under control conditions, cutaneous grill stimulation (interlaced 20/40 °C) evoked a sensation of heat, and for individual subjects, the magnitude of this heat sensation was positively correlated with cold pain threshold (CPT). Menthol increased the CPT and enhanced the magnitude of grill-evoked heat. Cinnamaldehyde intensified warm sensations, reduced heat pain threshold and also enhanced grill-evoked heat.
CONCLUSIONS: Both TRPM8-expressing and TRPA1-expressing afferent axons can affect grill-evoked thermal sensations. The enhancement of grill-evoked sensations of temperature with menthol and cinnamaldehyde may provide an additional clinically relevant means of testing altered thermal sensitivity, which is often affected in neuropathic patient groups.},

Compared to healthy controls, fibromyalgia patients reported stronger thermal grill-evoked cold, warm, unpleasantness and pain as well as stronger and more aversive 20 °C- and 40 °C-evoked sensations. They showed a loss in warm, mechanical and vibration detection, a gain in thermal pain thresholds and higher temporal summation (TS). Among QST parameters higher TS in fibromyalgia patients was most consistently associated with an augmented TGI. Independently, an increased TGI was linked to cold (20 °C) but less to warm (40 °C) perception. In fibromyalgia patients all thermal grill-evoked sensations were positively related to a higher 20 °C-evoked cold sensation and/or 20 °C-evoked unpleasantness. In conclusion, the TGI appears to be driven mainly by the cold-input.

	abstract = {Introduction
Cerebral projections of nociceptive stimuli are of great interest as targets for neuromodulation in chronic pain. To study cerebral networks involved in processing noxious stimuli, researchers often rely on thermo-nociception to induce pain. However, various limitations exist in many pain-inducing techniques, such as not accounting for individual variations in pain and trial structure predictability.
Methods
We propose an improved and reliable psychometric experimental method to evaluate human nociceptive processing to overcome some of these limitations. The developed testing paradigm leverages a custom-built, open-source, thermoelectric device (TED). The device construction and hardware are described. A maximum-likelihood adaptive algorithm is integrated into the TED software, facilitating individual psychometric functions representative of both hot and cold pain perception. In addition to testing only hot or cold thresholds, the TED may also be used to induce the thermal grill illusion (TGI), where the bars are set to alternating warm and cool temperatures.
Results
Here, we validated the TED's capability to adjust between different temperatures and showed that the device quickly and automatically changes temperature without any experimenter input. We also validated the device and integrated psychometric pain task in 21 healthy human subjects. Hot and cold pain thresholds (HPT, CPT) were determined in human subjects with {\textless}1 °C of variation. Thresholds were anticorrelated, meaning a volunteer with a low CPT likely had a high HPT. We also showed how the TED can be used to induce the TGI.
Conclusion
The TED can induce thermo-nociception and provide probabilistic measures of hot and cold pain thresholds. Based on the findings presented, we discuss how the TED could be used to study thermo-nociceptive cerebral projections if paired with intracranial electrode monitoring.},

It provides an interesting model of integrative mechanisms in the nervous system, supposed to be relevant in explaining the hypersensitivity found in chronic pain of unclear etiology. The aim of this study is to investigate the perceptual qualities elicited by a reconstruction of the original grill stimulator and to compare these qualities with those elicited by a single temperature thermode of identical dimensions. Healthy participants performed these comparisons by choosing adjectives describing the perceived sensory qualities. We hypothesized that the thermal grill would be perceived as different from a single temperature hot stimulus near pain threshold because of varying sensory qualities. Moreover, the qualities elicited by the grill were expected to be different from the qualities elicited by its single component temperatures. The thermal grill elicited a complex percept, which was distinguished almost perfect from a hot stimulus. The pattern of perceived qualities of the thermal grill differed from single temperature warm and hot stimuli. Pain-related sensations were less present in the grill percept than in a single hot stimulus near pain threshold. The spectrum of qualities of the grill stimulus changed marginally with stimulus duration by decrease of a cold component and concurrent increase of a heat component. In conclusion, the percept of the thermal grill is not simply pain--it can be understood as a metaesthetic percept at the transition from heat to pain.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Sensory illusions may reveal fundamental features of the nervous system. The thermal grill illusion is such a pain illusion, where interlaced warm and cool temperature bars (thermal grill) produce a paradoxical burning sensation. Previous studies have only systematically investigated the thermal grill illusion in pain-free volunteers. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the response to the thermal grill illusion was tolerable in patients with chronic pain and whether the response differed between patients with chronic pain and pain-free volunteers.
SUBJECTS: Sixteen pain-free participants and 18 chronic pain patients (seven not receiving opioids and 11 receiving opioids).
METHODS: The thermal grill response was investigated using a custom-built thermal grill. Heat and cold pain thresholds were also determined.
RESULTS: Chronic pain patients reported less intense pain, heat, and unpleasantness to the thermal grill compared with pain-free participants; in particular, there was an overall main effect for significantly less heat from the thermal grill compared with pain-free participants (P = 0.016). At the 22/38°C combination, although the majority of pain-free participants experienced the illusion to some degree, the majority of pain patients in both groups did not (median pain score 0). Although perceived heat from the thermal grill was significantly lower in chronic pain patients, both heat and cold pain thresholds did not differ among the three populations.
CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary data suggest that the thermal grill response may provide insights into pain sensitivity that are not detected by conventional thermal quantitative sensory testing.},

	abstract = {Purpose
This study aimed to use thermal grill illusion (TGI), an experimental model of pain processing and central mechanisms, to evaluate the perception of TGI-related sensations or pain in patients with chronic lower back pain (CLBP).

Patients and Methods
The perception of TGI (warmth/heat, cold, unpleasantness, pain, burning, stinging, and prickling) was examined in 66 patients with CLBP and compared with that in 22 healthy participants. The visual analog scale (VAS) scores for CLBP, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) scores were obtained from the included patients with CLBP.

Results
The CLBP group showed a less intense perception of TGI for sensations of warmth/heat, unpleasantness, and pain than the control group. The CLBP group felt burning sensations lesser than the control (2.77 vs 4.55, P=0.016). In the CLBP group, there were significant correlations between the ODI and the degree of unpleasantness (r=0.381, P=0.002) and prickling sensation (r=0.263, P=0.033). There were also significant correlations between the mental component score of the SF-12 and the degree of warmth/heat (r=−0.246, P=0.046), unpleasantness (r=−0.292, P=0.017), pain (r=−0.292, P=0.017), and burning sensations (r=−0.280, P=0.023).

Conclusion
Our results may be useful for clinicians to evaluate the effectiveness of drugs or interventions to manage centralized LBP.},

	abstract = {Central neuropathic pain arises from a lesion or disease of the central somatosensory nervous system such as brain injury, spinal cord injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis or related neuroinflammatory conditions. The incidence of central neuropathic pain differs based on its underlying cause. Individuals with spinal cord injury are at the highest risk; however, central post-stroke pain is the most prevalent form of central neuropathic pain worldwide. The mechanisms that underlie central neuropathic pain are not fully understood, but the pathophysiology likely involves intricate interactions and maladaptive plasticity within spinal circuits and brain circuits associated with nociception and antinociception coupled with neuronal hyperexcitability. Modulation of neuronal activity, neuron–glia and neuro-immune interactions and targeting pain-related alterations in brain connectivity, represent potential therapeutic approaches. Current evidence-based pharmacological treatments include antidepressants and gabapentinoids as first-line options. Non-pharmacological pain management options include self-management strategies, exercise and neuromodulation. A comprehensive pain history and clinical examination form the foundation of central neuropathic pain classification, identification of potential risk factors and stratification of patients for clinical trials. Advanced neurophysiological and neuroimaging techniques hold promise to improve the understanding of mechanisms that underlie central neuropathic pain and as predictive biomarkers of treatment outcome.},

We demonstrated previously that this thermal grill illusion can be explained as an unmasking phenomenon that reveals the central inhibition of pain by thermosensory integration1. In order to localize this unmasking in the human brain, we have used positron emission tomography (PET) to compare the cortical activation patterns evoked by the thermal grill and by cool, warm, noxious cold and noxious heat stimuli. The thermal grill illusion produces activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, whereas its component warm and cool stimuli do not. This area is also activated by noxious heat or cold. Thus, increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex appears to be selectively associated with the perception of thermal pain. Disruption of thermosensory and pain integration may account for the central pain syndrome that can occur after stroke damage.},

	abstract = {Background
Simultaneous presentation of non-noxious warm (40°C) and cold (20°C) stimuli in an interlacing fashion results in a transient hot burning noxious sensation (matched at 46°C) known as the thermal grill (TG) illusion. Functional magnetic resonance imaging and psychophysical assessments were utilized to compare the supraspinal events related to the spatial summation effect of three TG presentations: 20°C/20°C (G2020), 20°C/40°C (G2040) and 40°C/40°C (G4040) with corresponding matched thermode stimuli: 20°C (P20), 46°C (P46) and 40°C (P40) and hot pain (HP) stimuli.

Results
For G2040, the hot burning sensation was only noted during the initial off-line assessment. In comparison to P40, G4040 resulted in an equally enhanced response from all supraspinal regions associated with both pain sensory/discriminatory and noxious modulatory response. In comparison to P20, G2020 presentation resulted in a much earlier diminished/sedative response leading to a statistically significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) higher degree of deactivation in modulatory supraspinal areas activated by G4040. Granger Causality Analysis showed that while thalamic activation in HP may cast activation inference in all hot pain related somatosensory, affective and modulatory areas, similar activation in G2040 and G2020 resulted in deactivation inference in the corresponding areas.

Conclusions
In short, the transient TG sensation is caused by a dissociated state derived from non-noxious warm and cold spatial summation interaction. The observed central dissociated state may share some parallels in certain chronic neuropathic pain states.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: In the thermal grill illusion, participants experience a feeling similar to burning pain. The illusion is induced by simultaneously touching warm and cool stimuli in alternating positions. In post-stroke pain, central sensitization is caused by a variety of factors, including damage to the spinothalamic tract and shoulder pain. Because the thermal grill illusion depends on central mechanisms, it has recently been suggested that it may be a useful indicator of central sensitization. Therefore, we hypothesized that post-stroke patients who are more likely to experience central sensitization may also be more likely to experience a thermal grill sensation of pain and discomfort than the likelihood among those who are less likely to experience central sensitization. However, the effects of the thermal grill illusion in post-stroke patients have not yet been reported. In this pilot study, we conducted the thermal grill illusion procedure in post-stroke patients and analyzed the relationship between clinical somatosensory functions and thermal grill sensations. We also conducted brain imaging analysis to identify brain lesion areas that were associated with thermal grill sensations.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients (65.7 ± 11.9 years old) with post-stroke patients participated in this study. The thermal grill illusion procedure was performed as follows: patients simultaneously touched eight water-filled copper bars, with the water temperature adjusted to provide alternate warm (40°C) and cold (20°C) stimuli.
RESULTS: Thermal grill sensation of pain and discomfort tended to be associated with the wind-up phenomenon in bedside quantitative sensory testing and thermal grill sensation of discomfort was also related to damage to the thalamic lateral nucleus.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the thermal grill illusion might measure central sensitization, and that secondary brain hyperactivity might lead to increased thermal grill sensations.},

	abstract = {Aim
The main aim of this study was to assess if the perception of thermal pain thresholds is associated with genetically inferred levels of expression of the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT). Additionally, the perception of the so-called thermal grill illusion (TGI) was assessed. Forty-four healthy individuals (27 females, 17 males) were selected a-priori based on their 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 (‘tri-allelic 5-HTTLPR’) genotype, with inferred high or low 5-HTT expression. Thresholds for heat- and cold-pain were determined along with the sensory and affective dimensions of the TGI.

Results
Thresholds to heat- and cold-pain correlated strongly (rho  = −0.58, p{\textless}0.001). Individuals in the low 5-HTT-expressing group were significantly less sensitive to heat-pain (p = 0.02) and cold-pain (p = 0.03), compared to the high-expressing group. A significant gender-by-genotype interaction also emerged for cold-pain perception (p = 0.02); low 5-HTT-expressing females were less sensitive. The TGI was rated as significantly more unpleasant (affective-motivational dimension) than painful (sensory-discriminatory dimension), (p{\textless}0.001). Females in the low 5-HTT expressing group rated the TGI as significantly less unpleasant than high 5-HTT expressing females (p{\textless}0.05), with no such differences among men.

Conclusion/Significance
We demonstrate an association between inferred low 5-HTT expression and elevated thresholds to thermal pain in healthy non-depressed individuals. Despite the fact that reduced 5-HTT expression is a risk factor for chronic pain we found it to be related to hypoalgesia for threshold thermal pain. Low 5-HTT expression is, however, also a risk factor for depression where thermal insensitivity is often seen. Our results may thus contribute to a better understanding of the molecular underpinnings of such paradoxical hypoalgesia. The results point to a differential regulation of thermoafferent-information along the neuraxis on the basis of 5-HTT expression and gender. The TGI, suggested to rely on the central integration of thermoafferent-information, may prove a valuable tool in probing the affective-motivational dimension of these putative mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Background Perceptual illusions play an important role in untangling neural mechanisms underlying conscious phenomena. The thermal grill illusion (TGI) has been suggested as a promising model for exploring percepts involved in neuropathic pain, such as cold-allodynia (pain arising from contact with innocuous cold). The TGI is an unpleasant/painful sensation from touching juxtapositioned bars of cold and warm innocuous temperatures. Aim To develop an MRI-compatible TGI-unit and explore the supraspinal correlates of the illusion, using fMRI, in a group of healthy volunteers. Methods We constructed a TGI-thermode allowing the rapid presentation of warm(41°C), cold(18°C) and interleaved(41°C+18°C = TGI) temperatures in an fMRI-environment. Twenty volunteers were tested. The affective-motivational (“unpleasantness”) and sensory-disciminatory (“pain-intensity”) dimensions of each respective stimulus were rated. Functional images were analyzed at a corrected α-level {\textless}0.05. Results The TGI was rated as significantly more unpleasant and painful than stimulation with each of its constituent temperatures. Also, the TGI was rated as significantly more unpleasant than painful. Thermal stimulation versus neutral baseline revealed bilateral activations of the anterior insulae and fronto-parietal regions. Unlike its constituent temperatures the TGI displayed a strong activation of the right (contralateral) thalamus. Exploratory contrasts at a slightly more liberal threshold-level also revealed a TGI-activation of the right mid/anterior insula, correlating with ratings of unpleasantness(rho = 0.31). Conclusion/Significance To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fMRI-study of the TGI. The activation of the anterior insula is consistent with this region's putative role in processing of homeostatically relevant feeling-states. Our results constitute the first neurophysiologic evidence of thalamic involvement in the TGI. Similar thalamic activity has previously been observed during evoked cold-allodynia in patients with central neuropathic pain. Our results further the understanding of the supraspinal correlates of the TGI-phenomenon and pave the way for future inquiries into if and how it may relate to neuropathic pain.},

We examined the somatosensory profiles of 60 healthy participants (34 females, median age 25 years) using the quantitative sensory testing (QST) protocol from the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain. The number of PHS was measured using a modified thermal sensory limen (TSL) procedure where the skin was transiently pre-warmed, or pre-cooled before the PHS measure. This procedure also included a control condition with a pre-temperature of 32 °C. The number of TGI responses was quantified during simultaneous application of warm and cold innocuous stimuli. All participants had normal thermal and mechanical thresholds compared to the reference values from the QST protocol. Only two participants experienced PHS during the QST procedure. In the modified TSL procedure, we found no statistically significant differences in the number of participants reporting PHS in the control condition (N = 6) vs. pre-warming (N = 3; min = 35.7 °C, max = 43.5 °C) and pre-cooling (N = 4, min = 15.0 °C, max = 28.8 °C) conditions. Fourteen participants experienced TGI, and only one participant reported both TGI and PHS. Individuals with TGI had normal or even increased thermal sensation compared to individuals without TGI. Our findings demonstrate a clear distinction between individuals experiencing PHS or TGI, as there was no overlap observed when using identical warm and cold temperatures that were alternated either temporally or spatially. While PHS was previously related to sensory loss, our study revealed that TGI is associated with normal thermal sensitivity. This suggests that an efficient thermal sensory function is essential in generating the illusory sensation of pain of the TGI.},

PHS is uncommon in healthy individuals but common in patients with neuropathy and is associated with reduced thermal sensitivity. Identifying conditions that contribute to PHS may indirectly help us understand why some patients experience PHS. We hypothesized that pre-warming increased the number of PHS and that pre-cooling had minimal effect on PHS. We tested 100 healthy participants' thermal sensitivity on the dorsum of their feet by measuring detection and pain thresholds to cold and warm stimuli and PHS. PHS was measured using the thermal sensory limen (TSL) procedure from the quantitative sensory testing protocol of the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain and by using a modified TSL protocol (mTSL). In the mTSL we examined the participants' thermal detection and PHS after pre-warming of 38°C and 44°C and pre-cooling of 26°C and 20°C. Compared to a baseline condition, the number of PHS responders was significantly increased after pre-cooling (20°C: RR = 1.9 (1.1; 3.3), p = 0.023 and 26°C: RR = 1.9 (1.2; 3.2), p = 0.017), but not significantly after pre-warming (38°C: RR = 1.5 (0.86; 2.8), p = 0.21 and 44°C: RR = 1.7 (.995; 2.9), p = 0.078). Pre-warming and pre-cooling increased the detection threshold of both cold and warm temperatures. We discussed these findings in relation to thermal sensory mechanisms and possible PHS mechanisms. In conclusion, PHS and thermosensation are closely related and pre-cooling can induce PHS responses in healthy individuals.},

Its neurophysiological mechanisms are unclear, but TGIP may have some mechanisms in common with pathological pain, including central sensitization in particular, through the involvement of N-methyl- d -aspartate receptors. However, few studies have investigated TGIP in patients with chronic pain and its clinical relevance is uncertain. We hypothesized that the TGIP would be increased in comparison with controls in patients with fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome, which are regarded as typical "nociplastic" primary pain syndromes related to changes in central pain processing. We compared the sensations elicited by a large range of combinations of temperature differentials between the warm and cold bars of a thermal grill applied to the hand between patients with fibromyalgia (n = 30) or irritable bowel syndrome (n= 30) and controls (n = 30). The percentage of TGIP responses and the intensity and unpleasantness of TGIP were significantly greater in patients than controls. Furthermore, positive correlations were found between TGIP intensity and clinical pain intensity and between TGIP intensity and the cold pain threshold measured on the hand. These results are consistent with our working hypothesis of shared mechanisms between TGIP and clinical pain mechanisms in patients with nociplastic chronic pain syndromes and suggest that TGIP might represent a clinical marker of central sensitization in these patients.},

We investigated the role of the spinal cord in the generation of the TGI across two experiments (total n = 80). We applied heat and cold stimuli to dermatomes, areas of skin innervated by a single spinal nerve, that mapped onto adjacent or nonadjacent spinal segments. Enhanced warm and burning ratings during the TGI were observed when cold and warm stimuli were confined within the same dermatome. Further, heat perception was enhanced when the cold stimulus projected to the segment caudal to the warm stimulus, compared to the opposite spatial arrangement.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A common symptom of neuropathy is the misperception of heat and pain from cold stimuli. Similar cold allodynic sensations can be experimentally induced using the thermal grill illusion (TGI) in humans. It is currently unclear whether this interaction between thermosensory and nociceptive signals depends on spinal or supraspinal integration mechanisms. To address this issue, we developed a noninvasive protocol to assess thermosensory integration across spinal segments.
METHODS: We leveraged anatomical knowledge regarding dermatomes and their spinal projections to investigate potential contributions of spinal integration to the TGI. We simultaneously stimulated a pair of skin locations on the arm or lower back using 1 cold (∼20°C) and 1 warm thermode (∼40°C). The 2 thermodes were always separated by a fixed physical distance on the skin, but elicited neural activity across a varying number of spinal segments, depending on which dermatomal boundaries the 2 stimuli spanned.
RESULTS: Participants consistently overestimated the actual cold temperature on the skin during combined cold and warm stimulation, confirming the TGI effect. The TGI was present when cold and warm stimuli were delivered within the same dermatome, or across dermatomes corresponding to adjacent spinal segments. In striking contrast, no TGI effect was found when cold and warm stimuli projected to nonadjacent spinal segments.
INTERPRETATION: These results demonstrate that the strength of the illusion is modulated by the segmental distance between cold and warm afferents. This suggests that both temperature perception and thermal-nociceptive interactions depend upon low-level convergence mechanisms operating within a single spinal segment and its immediate neighbors.

	abstract = {Heat and pain illusions (synthetic heat and the thermal grill illusion) can be generated by simultaneous cold and warm stimulation on the skin at temperatures that would normally be perceived as innocuous in isolation. Historically, two key questions have dominated the literature: which specific pathway conveys the illusory perceptions of heat and pain, and where, specifically, does the illusory pain originate in the central nervous system? Two major theories - the addition and disinhibition theories - have suggested distinct pathways, as well as specific spinal or supraspinal mechanisms. However, both theories fail to fully explain experimental findings on illusory heat and pain phenomena. We suggest that the disagreement between previous theories and experimental evidence can be solved by abandoning the assumption of one-to-one relations between pathways and perceived qualities. We argue that a population coding framework, based on distributed activity across non-nociceptive and nociceptive pathways, offers a more powerful explanation of illusory heat and pain. This framework offers new hypotheses regarding the neural mechanisms underlying temperature and pain perception.},

Two parallel randomized, double-blind, cross-over studies, including two groups of 12 healthy volunteers, were carried out to compare the effects of i.v. ketamine or naloxone to those of placebo, on the sensations produced by a thermode (i.e. thermal grill) composed of six bars applied on the palmar surface of the right hand. The temperature of alternate (even- and odd-numbered) bars could be controlled independently by Peltier elements to produce various patterns of the grill. During each experimental session we measured the effects of ketamine, naloxone or placebo on the intensity of: (i) paradoxical pain; (ii) "normal" thermal (heat and cold) pain; and (iii) non-painful thermal (warm and cool) sensations. Ketamine administration resulted in a significant reduction of paradoxical pain intensity but did not alter normal pain or non-painful thermal sensations. By contrast, naloxone had no effect on paradoxical pain, normal pain or non-painful thermal sensations. This study demonstrates for the first time that the "thermal grill illusion of pain" can be modulated pharmacologically. This paradoxical pain, which involves the glutamatergic systems, acting through the NMDA receptors, but not the tonic endogenous opioids systems, might share some mechanisms with pathological pain.},

	abstract = {Interlaced cold and warm stimuli may induce a paradoxical burning sensation termed the "thermal grill illusion". Studies on the grill illusion have yielded contradictory results regarding its quality and intensity, which in turn led to controversies concerning the underlying mechanism. Some controversies may result from testing the illusion with absolute temperatures thereby disregarding inter-subjects' variation in temperature sensitivity. Therefore, our aim was to measure the individual threshold of the painful grill illusion (PGI). Another aim was to measure, here for the first time, the spatial boundaries of the PGI by spatially separating between the cooling and warming stimuli. Subjects (10 males, 15 females) underwent measurements of heat-pain (HPT) and cold-pain thresholds (CPT) with 9 and 18 cm(2) stimulating probes, on the forearm. Subjects also underwent measurement of pain threshold (PT), with one cooling and one heating probe (9 cm(2) each) activated simultaneously, and separated by 0-30 cm (distances encompassing one or two dermatomes). Simultaneous cold and warm stimuli produced burning pain at all separation distances. PT (approximately 26 and 38 degrees C) was significantly lower than CPT and HPT, respectively, and was relatively fixed across all distances except for 30 cm at which PT increased towards CPT and HPT values. Gender did not affect the PGI. In conclusion, innocuous cold and warm stimuli can spatially summate, both within and between dermatomes and evoke a PGI. Possibly, non-nociceptive channels integrate onto 2nd or 3rd order nociceptive neurons which in turn induce a unique painful burning resulting from the blend of cold and warm sensations.},

Twelve healthy volunteers participated in a randomised, double-blind, cross-over study to compare the effects of intravenous administration of morphine (0.025 or 0.1mg/kg) or placebo (saline). Stimuli were applied to the palm of the right hand with a thermode ("thermal grill") composed of six bars, whose temperatures were controlled by Peltier elements. For each session, we measured the heat and cold pain thresholds and then successively measured the intensity of: (i) paradoxical pain evoked by a combination of non-noxious warm and cold stimuli; (ii) "normal" pain evoked by suprathreshold heat or cold stimuli; (iii) non-painful sensations evoked by warm or cold stimuli at temperatures used to produce paradoxical pain. Measurements were performed before 20min after the administration of morphine or placebo and 5min after the administration of the morphine antagonist, naloxone. The administration of 0.1mg/kg of morphine, but not 0.025mg/kg, induced a significant and naloxone-reversible reduction of paradoxical pain intensity, which was directly correlated with the reduction of normal cold pain. No differences were observed for non-painful thermal sensations. The paradoxical burning pain evoked by a thermal grill can be modified pharmacologically by analgesics and share some mechanisms with normal pain.

Unidimensional adaptive testing methods make estimation of single threshold values faster and more efficient, but substantial efficiency can be further gained by taking into account the relationship between thresholds at different values of an independent variable. Here we present a generic method--1functional adaptive sequential testing (FAST)--for estimating thresholds as a function of another variable. This method allows efficient estimation of parameters relating an independent variable (e.g., stimulus spatial frequency; or reward delay) to the measured threshold along a stimulus strength dimension (e.g., contrast; or present monetary value). We formally describe the FAST algorithm and introduce a Matlab toolbox implementation thereof; we then evaluate several possible sampling and estimation algorithms for such two-dimensional functions. Our results demonstrate that efficiency can be substantially increased by considering the functional relationship between thresholds at different values of the independent variable of interest.},

	abstract = {In the social sciences it is common practice to test specific theoretically motivated research hypotheses using formal statistical procedures. Typically, students in these disciplines are trained in such methods starting at an early stage in their academic tenure. On the other hand, in psychophysical research, where parameter estimates are generally obtained using a maximum-likelihood (ML) criterion and data do not lend themselves well to the least-squares methods taught in introductory courses, it is relatively uncommon to see formal model comparisons performed. Rather, it is common practice to estimate the parameters of interest (e.g., detection thresholds) and their standard errors individually across the different experimental conditions and to 'eyeball' whether the observed pattern of parameter estimates supports or contradicts some proposed hypothesis. We believe that this is at least in part due to a lack of training in the proper methodology as well as a lack of available software to perform such model comparisons when ML estimators are used. We introduce here a relatively new toolbox of Matlab routines called Palamedes which allows users to perform sophisticated model comparisons. In Palamedes, we implement the model-comparison approach to hypothesis testing. This approach allows researchers considerable flexibility in targeting specific research hypotheses. We discuss in a non-technical manner how this method can be used to perform statistical model comparisons when ML estimators are used. With Palamedes we hope to make sophisticated statistical model comparisons available to researchers who may not have the statistical background or the programming skills to perform such model comparisons from scratch. Note that while Palamedes is specifically geared toward psychophysical data, the core ideas behind the model-comparison approach that our paper discusses generalize to any field in which statistical hypotheses are tested.},

This is the case when either a step function or a constant function is associated with a higher likelihood than the model can attain with finite parameter values. In such cases iterative search procedures may erroneously report having successfully converged on a maximum in the likelihood function.

I describe a method by which such false convergences can be reliably detected. I also present results of simulations that systematically investigate how stimulus placement, number of trials, parameters estimated, task (2AFC, 4AFC, etc.), and whether the lapse rate is allowed to vary affect the probability that the likelihood function will not contain a maximum.

	abstract = {Cold and warm stimuli delivered over a larger skin area tend to be more easily detected/elicit stronger sensations, a phenomenon referred to as spatial summation. The aim of the present study was to clarify how stimulation area affects thermal detection processes by evaluating whether increasing the stimulation area simply reduces the detection threshold or also reduces the uncertainty of the detection process. Psychometric functions were fitted to the detection performance of 16 healthy subjects. Stimuli (duration: 200 ms; rate of change: 300 °C/s) were delivered to the volar forearm using a Peltier-effect contact thermode and three different stimulation surfaces (23 mm2, 69 mm2, and 116 mm). Stimulation intensities were selected trial-by-trial by the psi marginal method to optimize estimation of slope and threshold parameters of the psychometric function. The raw data (100 stimulus–response pairs per subject per surface and per modality) was used to fit group-level hierarchical models of cold and warm detection, allowing to assess the effect of stimulation surface and account for inter-individual variability. Increasing stimulation area led to a compression of the psychometric function towards baseline skin temperature (reduced threshold and steeper slope), suggesting that spatial summation reflects a change in the precision of the neural representation of the stimulus which in turn influences the ability of the nervous system to distinguish true stimuli from sensory noise. Regardless of area, with the stimulation settings used in this study, cold detection appeared easier than warm detection, possibly because of structural and functional differences between cold- and warm-sensitive afferents.},

The model assumes independent observations of the response variable y given the parameters, the explanatory variables and the values of the random effects. The distribution for the response variable in the GAMLSS can be selected from a very general family of distributions including highly skew or kurtotic continuous and discrete distributions. The systematic part of the model is expanded to allow modelling not only of the mean (or location) but also of the other parameters of the distribution of y, as parametric and/or additive nonparametric (smooth) functions of explanatory variables and/or random-effects terms. Maximum (penalized) likelihood estimation is used to fit the (non)parametric models. A Newton–Raphson or Fisher scoring algorithm is used to maximize the (penalized) likelihood. The additive terms in the model are fitted by using a backfitting algorithm. Censored data are easily incorporated into the framework. Five data sets from different fields of application are analysed to emphasize the generality of the GAMLSS class of models.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The application to the skin of spatially interlaced innocuous warm (40 °C) and cool (20 °C) thermodes (termed a thermal grill--TG) can produce an unusual thermal percept, but the mechanisms remain unclear.
METHODS: We compared the percept quality and intensity over a 120-s period evoked by each of three configurations of a 6-bar thermal stimulator (6 TS): all 40 °C(WARM); all 20 °C(COOL); alternating bars 40/20 °C (TG) at two body sites (forearm and palm).
RESULTS: Both unpleasantness and pain were significantly greater for the TG-induced (vs. either COOL- or WARM-induced) percept. Unpleasantness ratings were significantly higher than pain intensity ratings. Several emotional qualitative descriptors were unique to the TG-induced percept. TG palmar (vs. forearm) stimulation produced a more intense percept and was perceived as painful in more subjects. Temporal profiles of intensities of TG-induced percepts differed from those induced by the COOL or WARM thermodes alone. For both unpleasantness and pain, the site differences in the temporal profile were also unique for TG versus the COOL- or WARM-evoked percepts. Qualitative characteristics of the TG-induced percept varied over time and between subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: The TG percept intensity and temporal profile were different from those evoked by either of its component parts. The perceived quality is person-specific. These differences suggest that the classic 'TG illusion' results from complex central integration of several types of peripheral afferent inputs activated by the TG. Differing body site-related roles of thermosensory afferents in discrimination versus temperature homeostasis may explain site-related variations in the percept.},

	abstract = {Background The thermal grill illusion (TGI) refers to the perception of burning heat and often pain that arises from simultaneous cutaneous application of innocuous warm and cool stimuli. This study utilized conditioned pain modulation (CPM) to help elucidate the TGI's underlying neural mechanisms, including the debated role of ascending nociceptive signals in generating the illusion. Methods To trigger CPM, subjects placed the left hand in noxious cold (6 °C) water before placing the right volar forearm onto a thermal grill. Lower pain and unpleasantness ratings of the grill in this CPM run compared to those in a control run (i.e. 33 °C water) were taken as evidence of CPM. To determine whether CPM reduces noxious heat pain and illusory heat pain equally, an experimental group of subjects rated pain and unpleasantness of a grill consisting of innocuous alternating warm (42 °C) and cool (18 °C) bars, while a control group rated a grill with all bars controlled to a noxious temperature (45 °C). Results CPM produced significant and comparable reductions in pain, unpleasantness and perceived heat of both noxious heat and the TGI. Conclusions This result suggests that the TGI results from signals in nociceptive dorsal horn convergent neurons, since CPM involves descending inhibition with high selectivity for this neuronal population. More broadly, CPM's ability to produce a shift in perceived thermal sensation of both noxious heat and the TGI from ‘hot’ to ‘warm’ implies that nociceptive signals generated by a cutaneous stimulus can contribute to its perceived thermal intensity. Significance Conditioned pain modulation reduces the perceived painfulness, unpleasantness and heat of the thermal grill illusion and noxious heat similarly. The results have important theoretical implications for both types of pain.},

	abstract = {Aims
This study aimed to investigate the quality of the thermal grill illusion (TGI) and the importance of stimulus parameters (distance between, and number of stimulation bars).
Material and methods
Twenty-one different stimuli were applied to a group of 19 healthy subjects on the glabrous skin over the palm and fingers.
Results
The TGI was found to be painful (19.42\% on the palm; 17.98\% on the fingers), mechanical (25.24\% on the palm; 5.62\% on the fingers), emotional (13.59\% on the palm; 14.61\% on the fingers) or unusual (42.72\% on the palm; 61.8\% on the fingers) sensations. A total of 89.5\% (palm) and 94.4\% (fingers) of the subjects reported TGI. Between 45\% (fingers) and 50\% (palm) of the stimuli elicited TGI. Neither the distance (2 ∼ 10mm) between adjacent warm (40±1°C) and cold (20±1°C) bars nor the number of the stimulation bars (2 ∼ 6) significantly affected the occurrence of the TGI (N.S.). The average reaction time was 2.4±0.1seconds to the TGI sensation. Females showed longer reaction time than males (P≤0.001).
Conclusion
The distance and number of stimulation bars were not important to the sensation of TGI, of which the responses varied. These results are useful for future TGI studies with respect to experimental design. The variability of the TGI needs to be considered in future experimental and clinical studies.
Résumé
But de l’étude
Cette étude a pour objet d’analyser qualitativement l’illusion de la grille thermale (IGT) et l’importance des paramètres de stimulation (nombre de barres de stimulation et intervalles entre celles-ci).
Matériel et méthode
Vingt et un stimuli différents ont été utilisés sur un groupe de 19 personnes en bonne santé. Les stimuli ont été appliqués sur une partie de peau lisse et glabre des paumes et des doigts.
Résultats
Les sensations de la IGT ont été définies comme : douloureuses (paume : 19,42 \% ; doigts : 17,98 \%), mécaniques (paume : 25,24 \% ; doigts : 5,62 \%), émotionnelles (paume :13,59 \%; doigts : 14,61 \%) ou inhabituelles (paume : 42,72 \% ; doigts : 61,8 \%). Un total de 89,5 \% (paume) et 94,4 \% (doigts) des sujets font état de sensations IGT. Entre 45 \% (doigts) et 50 \% (paume) font état des stimuli provoqués par la IGT. Ni l’intervalle (2 ∼ 10mm) entre les barres chaudes (40±1°C) et froides (20±1°C) voisines ni le nombre de barres de stimulation (2 ∼ 6) n’ont affecté de façon significative l’incidence de la IGT (N.S.). Le temps de réaction moyen à la sensation IGT a été de 2,4±0,1secondes. Les femmes ont montré un temps de réaction plus long que les hommes (p≤0,001).
Conclusion
L’intervalle entre les barres et le nombre de barres de stimulation n’ont pas eu d’importance pour la sensation de la IGT, compte tenu de la variation des réponses. Ces résultats peuvent aider à la conception expérimentale de futures études IGT. La variabilité de la IGT doit être prise en considération dans de futures études cliniques expérimentales.},

Paradoxical heat sensation rarely occurs in healthy individuals but more frequently in patients suffering from lesions or disease of the peripheral or central nervous system. To further understand mechanisms and epidemiology of PHS, we evaluated the occurrence of PHS in relation to disease aetiology, pain levels, quantitative sensory testing parameters, and Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) items in patients with nervous system lesions. Data of 1090 patients, including NPSI scores from 404 patients, were included in the analysis. We tested 11 quantitative sensory testing parameters for thermal and mechanical detection and pain thresholds, and 10 NPSI items in a multivariate generalised linear model with PHS, aetiology, and pain (yes or no) as fixed effects. In total, 30\% of the neuropathic patients reported PHS in contrast to 2\% of healthy individuals. The frequency of PHS was not linked to the presence or intensity of pain. Paradoxical heat sensation was more frequent in patients living with polyneuropathy compared with central or unilateral peripheral nerve lesions. Patients who reported PHS demonstrated significantly lower sensitivity to thermal perception, with lower sensitivity to normally painful heat and cold stimuli. Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory scores were lower for burning and electric shock-like pain quality for patients with PHS. Our findings suggest that PHS is associated with loss of small thermosensory fibre function normally involved in cold and warm perception. Clinically, presence of PHS could help screening for loss of small fibre function as it is straightforward to measure or self-reported by patients.},

Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired 'inference at a glance' nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These "raincloud plots" can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper, we provide basic demonstrations of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab ( https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots). Readers can investigate the R and Python tutorials interactively in the browser using Binder by Project Jupyter.},

	abstract = {We investigated the contributions of warm and cool signals in generating the thermal grill illusion (TGI), a phenomenon in which interlaced warm and cool bars generate an experience of burning, and under some conditions painful, heat. Each subject underwent 3 runs, 2 of which tested the effects of preadapting subjects to the grill's warm or cool bars (while the interlaced bars were thermally neutral) on the subsequent intensity of the illusion. In a control run, all bars were neutral during the adaptation phase. Thermal visual analogue scale ratings during the warm and cool adaptation periods revealed significant and equivalent adaptation to the 2 temperatures. Adaptation to the grill's cool bars significantly reduced pain and perceived thermal intensity of the TGI, compared to the control condition, while adaptation to the grill's warm bars had little effect. These results suggest that the cool stimulus triggers the pain signals that produce the illusion. The inability of warm adaptation to attenuate the TGI is at odds with theories suggesting that the illusion depends upon a simple addition of warm and cool signals. While the grill's cool bars are necessary for the TGI's painfulness, we also observed that the more often a participant reported feeling coolness or coldness, the less pain he or she experienced from the TGI. These results are consistent with research showing that cool temperatures generate activity in both thermoreceptive-specific, pain-inhibitory neurons and nociceptive dorsal horn neurons.},

	abstract = {The human brain has a remarkable ability to learn and update its beliefs about the world. Here, we investigate how thermosensory learning shapes our subjective experience of temperature and the misperception of pain in response to harmless thermal stimuli. Through computational modeling, we demonstrate that the brain uses a probabilistic predictive coding scheme to update beliefs about temperature changes based on their uncertainty. We find that these expectations directly modulate the perception of pain in the thermal grill illusion. Quantitative microstructural brain imaging revealed that the myeloarchitecture and iron content of the somatosensory cortex, the posterior insula and the amygdala reflect inter-individual variability in computational parameters related to learning and the degree to which uncertainty modulates illusory pain perception. Our findings offer a new framework to explain how the brain infers pain from innocuous thermal inputs. Our model has important implications for understanding the etiology of thermosensory symptoms in chronic pain conditions.},

	abstract = {Paradoxical Heat Sensation (PHS) is the remarkable feeling of warmth or heat pain while the skin is cooling. Despite its initial documentation over 100 years ago, a unified explanation for this perplexing experience remains elusive. Here we apply contrast enhancement principles, known for their instrumental role in understanding visual illusions, to the domain of thermosensation. Contrast enhancement describes the amplification of two contrasting visual features, such as the enhanced perception of an edge between a light and dark bar. In thermosensation, this encompasses an enhancement of the difference between sequential warming and cooling of the skin, and is defined as the normalised difference between successive temporal warm and cold temperatures. Remarkably, thermal contrast predicts the occurrence of PHS. Our findings reveal compelling evidence supporting the role of thermal contrast in the generation of PHS, shedding light on its underlying mechanism and offering a framework for broader encoding principles in thermosensation and pain.},

such as mood, distress, fatigue, and quality of life. Yet, these factors and their relationship to pain
sensitivity have typically been investigated in isolation from one another, and with insufficiently
powered sample sizes. To overcome these limitations, we implemented a multivariate latent
variable modeling approach in a sizable sample of adult participants (n = 257), enabling us to
examine the interplay between unique psychological factors and thermal pain sensitivity. Through
exploratory factor analysis of 10 mental health questionnaires, we identified three mental health
factors related to distress, fatigue and bodily symptoms. Additionally, we established a measure of
laboratory pain sensitivity using principal component analyses of three thermal pain thresholds
(i.e., cold, heat and simultaneously cold and heat). Regression models revealed no relationships
between psychological factors and laboratory-based measures of thermal pain in individuals whose
mental health ranged from no discernible symptoms to those with subclinical and clinical
manifestations. Our findings provided evidence supporting the lack of a linear association between
psychological factors, either individually or as a collective construct, and thermal pain sensitivity.},
